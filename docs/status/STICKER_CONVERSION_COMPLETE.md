# Sticker Image Conversion Complete ✅

## Summary
All sticker preview images have been converted to WebP format and folder names have been fixed.

## What Was Done

### 1. Converted PNG to WebP (10 files)
All `.png` files in `sticker_collections/` were converted to `.webp` format with high quality (95%) and the original PNG files were deleted.

**Converted files:**
- ✅ city_holder/diamond_pack/1.png → 1.webp (29KB)
- ✅ city_holder/golden_pack/1.png → 1.webp (21KB)
- ✅ city_holder/holiday_pack/1.png → 1.webp (24KB)
- ✅ chimpers_dojo/chimpers_x_jarritos/1.png → 1.webp (7.6KB)
- ✅ dogs_ny/dogs_ny/1.png → 1.webp (15KB)
- ✅ not_pixel/pixel_knight/1.png → 1.webp (7.2KB)
- ✅ not_pixel/pixel_earth/1.png → 1.webp (7.1KB)
- ✅ not_pixel/pixangel/1.png → 1.webp (7.5KB)
- ✅ not_pixel/pixevil/1.png → 1.webp (7.3KB)
- ✅ not_ny_exe/not_ny_exe/1.png → 1.webp (11KB)

### 2. Fixed Folder Names
Renamed folders to match the expected naming convention (lowercase, underscores, no spaces):

- ✅ `diamond_pack ` → `diamond_pack` (removed trailing space)
- ✅ `chimpers _x_jarritos` → `chimpers_x_jarritos` (removed space before underscore)
- ✅ `Pix_angel` → `pixangel` (lowercase, removed underscore)
- ✅ `Pix_evil` → `pixevil` (lowercase, removed underscore)

### 3. Verification Results
- **Total stickers**: 218
- **Stickers with preview images**: 218 (100%) ✅
- **Missing images**: 0
- **PNG files remaining**: 0

## File Format
All sticker preview images are now in WebP format:
- Better compression (smaller file sizes)
- High quality (95% quality setting)
- Faster loading times
- Consistent format across all stickers

## Next Steps
The sticker functionality is now fully operational with all preview images available in the correct format and folder structure.

You can test it with:

```

All 218 stickers should now display correctly with their preview images.
